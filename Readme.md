# Online Store & Admin System

## What it does

The project is an online store and web application to manage a dance academy named Salsa Candela. It sells Salsa and Bachata courses and has five branches.

## The online store

The online store shows information about the academy, its classes, times, locations and prices. Visitors can enroll and pay online.

After buying a course, the user is sent to a confirmation page and given a QR confirmation code. A copy of the code is also sent by email.

## The management application

In the Dance Academy, the management web application provides several functions:

- An enrollment form for people paying in cash.
- An access control system to make sure people with QR codes are enrolled.
- A report page with displaying the enrolled users and all payment and course data.

This allows the dance studio to have better administrative controls and assist with the management of the business.
