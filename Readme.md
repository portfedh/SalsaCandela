# Online Store & Admin System

## What it does

Welcome to Salsa Candela, an online platform and management system tailored for a dance academy. 

As the central hub for the Salsa and Bachata courses across its five branches, this project aims to provide a seamless and engaging experience for both students and administrators.

## The online store

Explore detailed information about the academy, class schedules, locations, and pricing. Visitors can easily enroll and make secure online payments. Upon purchase, users receive a QR confirmation code for seamless entry into the world of dance. Additionally, a confirmation email is sent, ensuring a hassle-free registration process.

## The management application

The management side of the web application offers a range of features:

- **Enrollment Form:** Facilitates cash payments for those preferring offline transactions.
  
- **Access Control System:** Ensures that only users with valid QR codes gain entry, enhancing security and organization.
  
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** A dedicated page showcasing enrolled users and detailed payment and course data. This invaluable tool aids in efficient business management.
