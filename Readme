# Dance Academy Online Store & Admin System

## What it does

The project was to build an online store and a web application to manage a dance academy that sells Salsa and Bachata courses and has five branches.

## The online store

The online store is meant to provide information about the classes, times, locations and prices, and to provide the user the ability to enroll and pay online.

Once a user buys a course, they get are sent to a confirmation page with a QR code. A copy of the code is also sent by email to the user.

## The management application

In the Dance Academy, the management web application will provide several functions:

- An access control system to make sure users taking the class are enrolled.
- An enrollment form for people paying in cash.
- A report page with displaying the users, class, payment method and the amounts payed.

This will allow the dance studio to improve its admin controls and assist with the mangment of the business.

## Live view

The web application is still in development, but you can see it here:
